# EulerPojects

Using c#, I am building algorithms to solve the projects on https://projecteuler.net



### Euler Project 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
